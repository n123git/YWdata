# YWdata
YW data and asset dumps, primarily focused on YW2

## Wallpaper Stich
This comes with dumps of every wallpaper in YW2 in 3 forms: combined, overlay and spritesheet.
`combined` can be found as `canvas.png` and is what you'd see ingame (but one frame, not animated).
`overlay` can be found as `001.png` and is the white overlay as a tile i.e. flowers.
`spritesheet` can be found as `000.png` and is the main background as a spritesheet.
This tool also comes with `wallpaperstitch.html` which can be used to stitch wallpapers yourself (maybe if you want to dump yw3 wallpapers).
I am planning to make a reversestitch to aid in making custom wallpapers for mods :D
Note: the dumps dont include the error/debug wallpaper as it is plain-black, not in the files and isn't supposed to occur in-game.

## Translator Tool
A tool to translate and grab the IDs of Yo-kai watch things via the official translations ripped from the gamer, currently only supports YW2, YW3, YW1, YWB1 and YWB2 support is planned.
