# YWdata
YW data and asset dumps, primarily focused on YW2

## Wallpaper Stich
There are 10 folders named 001-010, 001 is wallpaper ID 0 aka Cool Blue, 002 = ID 1 etc.</br>
 These hold dumps of every wallpaper in YW2. in 3 forms: combined, overlay and spritesheet.</br>
`combined` can be found as `canvas.png` and is what you'd see ingame (but it's one still frame; not animated).
`overlay` is `001.png` and is the tiled white overlay i.e. flowers.
`spritesheet` is stored as `000.png` and is the main background displayed as a spritesheet.
This tool also comes with `wallpaperstitch.html` which can be used to stitch wallpapers yourself (perhaps useful if you want to dump yw3 wallpapers, make frankenstein abominations aka merge wallpapers, etc).
I am planning to make a reversestitch to aid in making custom wallpapers for mods (and dump yw3 wallpapers) :D
Note: the dumps dont include the error/debug wallpaper (IDs 10-255) as it is plain-black, not in the files and isn't supposed to occur in-game.

## Translator Tool
A tool to translate and grab the IDs of Yo-kai watch things via the official translations ripped from the gamer, currently only supports YW2, YW3, YW1, YWB1 and YWB2 support is planned. This tool supports MacOS, Linux, Windows and ANY modern OS that can run a up-to-date version of a web browser.
